# THOE

The **Threat Oracle Engine** (THOE) is the tool for scanning the system for known vulnerabilities based on the information obtained from online vulnerability databases, such as, for example, [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) database. THOE is a solution for industrial control systems, including embedded systems with limited resources, and it enables:
-	Automatic detection of publicly known vulnerabilities affecting software and hardware used by a product during its development process and whole lifecycle.
-	Searching for vulnerabilities published in different data sources, such as NVD, ExploitDB, etc. It is flexible enough to allow adding new sources.
-	Continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities and configuration
-	Local or remote search of vulnerabilities
